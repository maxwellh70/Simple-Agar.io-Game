The program is a GUI with moving balls (think of the game agar.io) and other balls/elements (inherited from the base class) with different functions. Other elements may include ball spawners and generators, black holes, balls that eat other balls to name a few. The GUI is from a simple tkinter and there are some buttons that would spawn or delete balls or have special functions. The main components of object oriented coding done here was the inheritance hierarchy, particularly through extending the base classes.
